                   Hi, I'm Kayleigh Young, a full-stack web-developer based in Dallas, Texas.

                    If you need an excited engineer who can pick up on new concepts in the drop of a hat, or a cool coder who thinks outside the box- congratulations, your life just got better.
                    I am one of those people who " just gets it " when it comes to programing.
